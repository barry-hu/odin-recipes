My name is Barry and I just starting out learning coding through the Odin Project. I hope to eventually be able to use Javascript to code at a Senior engineering level but for now I am just beginning. This will be my first project. In this project, I hope to be able to use git commands to add, commit, and upload my project onto git hub comfortably.

Another goal I have for this current project is to be able to create a simple webpage being able to use link and image elements competently and efficiently. I hope to also apply tags and attributes properly as well.

Side note: I am pretty impatient and mad right now as I accidently deleted my entire desktop and my completed first project. This is a redo :'(
